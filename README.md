Sample projects

# [Project 1: Portfolio Web Site](https://github.com/PrinceDuru/Express_Portfolio_Site_Authentication)
This is a web application which documents my project portfolio explaining a few of my projects. 
It consists of a Home page, About Me page, Projects, Services, Contact and login pages.
The login page manages authentication and access to a secure section of the site that displays my contact list.
The contact list is stored in a backend database which is connected to the site.

## Features
- ExpressJS was used to implement EJS templating engine
- NodeJS was used as the back-end JavaScript environment
- CSS was used for styling of the web pages
- Mongo DB was used for storing data and other CRUD operations
- JavaScript was used for the front-end development

# [Project 2: KNN_Diabetes_Prediction](https://github.com/PrinceDuru/KNN_Diabetes_Prediction)
This is a Machine Learning model trained to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based some diagnostic measurements. The dataset used is from NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)

* Tableau was used to analyze the dataset to get some insights.
* ome statistical analyses were also done to confirm the distribution of the data, to check for outliers and to check correlations among the variables.
* Data preprocessing was done to clean up the dataset and to make it fit for modeling
* Feature engineering was done to select the top 5 features on the strength of feature importance.
* Various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, SVM and KNN classifiers were used to train the data with minimal parameter tuning.
* Performances of the various models were evaluated. KNN model gave the best performance with 76% accuracy and a AUC score of 83%.
* The trained KNN model was deploy on Heroku platform using Flask as the web framework to serve the web page to allow input of test data, and for the model to display predicted result.

## Features
* Data analysis was done using both Tableau and Jupyter Notebook.
* Python - Numpy, Pandas, and Sklearn - was used for the Machine Learning project.
* Flask, a Python web framework was used to serve the web page.
* HTML, CSS, Jinja2 template were also used for the web page


# [Project 3: Java CRUD Console Application](https://github.com/PrinceDuru/JavaCRUDApp)
This is a console GUI Java application that allows games players to submit information about themselves and the games they are playing online. 
The submitted information is stored in a simple Oracle database. Users are able to make changes to their stored information and have the changes updated in the database. Users are also able to diplay the report of their information on the console as contained in the database.

## Features

- Console application
- Built in Java
- JavaFx library used for GUI
- Oracle Database used for storing data and other CRUD operations
